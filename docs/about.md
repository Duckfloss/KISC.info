The Kalamazoo Immigrant Solidarity Coalition is an affiliation of individuals working to support immigrants in Kalamazoo and SW Michigan.

We want to ensure that non-citizens, whether undocumented, DACA, asylum seeking, on temporary protected status, refugees, or others living in our community are respected, know their rights, and are recognized for their many positive achievements and contributions.

We counter racist and demonstratively false claims made by Donald Trump and others that immigrants are criminals, take jobs from citizens, or are a burden on taxpayers or society. We do not want to see our decent, hard-working neighbors, friends, and family members torn from their homes, schools, or places of worship, taken to detention camps, or deported. They need access, like all of us, to vital services, including health care, education, transportation, legal support and representation, public safety, etc.

We work in teams to educate ourselves and others, support individuals and families, influence social institutions, develop resources to counter and address scapegoating and anti-immigrant hysteria. Newcomers are welcome to join any of these subgroups. We communicate by email and encrypted phone applications, as individuals prefer.

We recognize the value of direct action and mutual aide, and our actions in solidarity with members of our community are taken openly and within the law.
